# Developing plane channel flow at Reynolds number of 50000. 

A mesh was generated with 100 cells in the streamwise direction and 50 cells normal to the wall. This mesh is fine enough to resolve velocity gradients near the wall as the wall y+ value is less than 2. To obtain a Reynolds number of 50000 based on the half-width of the channel, an inlet velocity of 0.75m/s was applied. The plots show the flow being developed from the inlet to the outlet, along the streamwise direction. The velocity vectors show the boundary layer in the developed region. The maximum value of turbulent kinetic energy is reducing as the flow develops in the streamwise direction.
